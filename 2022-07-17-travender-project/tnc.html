            Precautions</p>
        <h1>Q. What kind of precautions should I follow
            during the trip?</h1>
        <h1>A. There are 5 rules to avoid Coronavirus. You
            should follow and apply this to your loved ones
            during the trip. </h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Always wear a mask in a crowded place. </li>
            <li>Wash your hands from both sides with good quality handwash certified by medical
                professionals.
            </li>
            <li>Carry a sanitizer with you after touching anything then sanitize your hands properly.
            </li>
            <li>Maintain at least one-meter distance with everybody if not possible then leave that place
                immediately and search for the safe place.</li>
            <li>If you and your tripmates like friends, or a family member feel something awkward then
                immediately call for medical help and get checked.
            </li>
            <h1>Q. How to get medical help immediately?</h1>
            <p>A. You can call 1075 immediately without any delay and if not possible then inform your trip leader
                instantly. If you feel uncomfortable then do not start your trip because in between the trip, at some
