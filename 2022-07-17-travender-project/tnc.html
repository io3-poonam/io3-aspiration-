            Precautions</p>
        <h1>Q. What kind of precautions should I follow
            during the trip?</h1>
        <h1>A. There are 5 rules to avoid Coronavirus. You
            should follow and apply this to your loved ones
            during the trip. </h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Always wear a mask in a crowded place. </li>
            <li>Wash your hands from both sides with good quality handwash certified by medical
                professionals.
            </li>
            <li>Carry a sanitizer with you after touching anything then sanitize your hands properly.
            </li>
            <li>Maintain at least one-meter distance with everybody if not possible then leave that place
                immediately and search for the safe place.</li>
            <li>If you and your tripmates like friends, or a family member feel something awkward then
                immediately call for medical help and get checked.
            </li>
            <h1>Q. How to get medical help immediately?</h1>
            <p>A. You can call 1075 immediately without any delay and if not possible then inform your trip leader
